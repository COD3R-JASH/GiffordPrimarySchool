We offer a range of clubs, free of charge, to children of all ages across key stages 1 and 2 and view these opportunities as another way in which the school can build on the cultural capital of children. Activities include sports, music, art and book clubs. Children are able to explore who they are, what they enjoy and what they are good at whilst having lots of fun, making new friends and developing skills.</p>

            <img src="attendance.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">In today's competitive world, with increasing working hours and less classroom time, teachers need edTech tools which help them manage precious class time efficiently. Instead of focusing on teaching, faculty members are often stuck with completing formal duties, for e.g. taking daily student attendance.

              Manually taking attendance and registering it in files & musters makes the daily attendance a mundane task for the faculty and unnecessarily consumes classroom time.<br>
              
              To overcome such inefficient work processes, there are various school software systems available to speed up the attendance process and reduce manual work.<br> An online attendance management system or digital attendance platform is one of them, which is developed to automate the daily attendance in schools.<br> Additionally, it helps to maintain accurate records and generate summarized student attendance reports.
              
              Attendance management system keeps track of daily attendance, working hours, breaks, login, and logout time. It prevents staff's time theft.<br> An attendance management system integrates all attendance devices such as smart cards, biometric, and facial recognition devices in real-time.</p></li>
